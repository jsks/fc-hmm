It draws on a new, broader conceptualization of frozen conflicts that revolves around an unresolved core issue between the warring parties and transcends the common understanding of frozen conflicts as a recent, post-Soviet phenomenon. The authors identify 42 cases of such conflicts between 1946 and 2011 that include conflict dyads involving both regular states and ‘de facto states’. The article describes the process of dataset construction, presents summary statistics, and identifies key patterns concerning conflict onset, escalation, and resolution. In addition, it provides a comparison of the dataset with enduring rivalries and strategic rivalries to situate it within existing research on conflict escalation and conflict resolution. The dataset is presented in a cross-sectional format compatible with the Correlates of War and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program that can be used by other researchers in peace and conflict studies to provide new insights into the dynamics of frozen conflicts.},

Despite the clear policy relevance of this problem, the notion of frozen conflicts remains surprisingly blurred in peace and conflict studies literature. In this paper, we seek to provide a rigorous conceptualization of frozen conflicts. We situate frozen conflicts into a broader debate about enduring rivalries in international politics and demonstrate the theoretical relevance of the term vis-à-vis existing concepts. Furthermore, we outline a theoretical model of frozen conflict dynamics, which portrays frozen conflicts as dynamic configurations undergoing a periodical Bthawing{\textasciicircum} in relations between the opposing sides: either toward diplomatic negotiations (Bpeaceful thawing{\textasciicircum}) or re-escalation toward use of armed force (Bviolent thawing{\textasciicircum}). We illustrate the usefulness of our model with empirical observations from other articles in this special issue and conclude with possible avenues for further research.},

	abstract = {This contribution to the {ViEWS} prediction competition 2020 proposes using Markov modeling to model the change in the logarithm of battle-related deaths between two points in time in a country. The predictions are made using two ensembles of observed and hidden Markov models, where the covariate sets for the ensembles are drawn from the {ViEWS} country month constituent models. The weights for the individual models in the ensembles were obtained using a genetic algorithm optimizing the fit on the {TADDA}-score in a calibration set. The weighted ensembles of visible and hidden Markov models outperform the {ViEWS} prediction competition benchmark models on the {TADDA} score in the test period of January 2017 to December 2019 for all time steps. Forecasts until March 2021 predict increased violence primarily in Algeria, Libya, Tchad, Niger, and Angola, and decreased or unchanged levels of violence in most of the remaining countries in Africa. An analysis of the model weights in the ensembles shows that the conflict history constituent model provided by {ViEWS} was dominant in the ensembles. Esta contribución a la competencia de predicciones 2020 del Sistema de Alerta Temprana de Violencia (Violence Early Warning System, {ViEWS}) propone utilizar la modelización de Márkov para elaborar un modelo del cambio en el logaritmo de las muertes relacionadas con batallas entre dos puntos temporales en un país. Las predicciones se elaboran con dos conjuntos de modelos observados y ocultos de Márkov, en los que los grupos de covariables de los conjuntos se obtienen de los modelos constituyentes mensuales de los países del {ViEWS}. La relevancia de los modelos individuales en los conjuntos se obtuvo mediante un algoritmo genético que optimiza el ajuste de la puntuación {TADDA} en un grupo de calibración. Los conjuntos ponderados de los modelos visibles y ocultos de Márkov superan los modelos de referencia de la competencia de predicciones del {ViEWS} en relación con la puntuación {TADDA} (Distancia absoluta orientada con aumento de dirección) en el período de prueba de enero de 2017 a diciembre de 2019 para todos los intervalos de tiempo. Las predicciones hasta marzo de 2021 pronostican un aumento en la violencia principalmente en Argelia, Libia, Chad, Níger y Angola, y niveles de violencia disminuidos o sin variaciones en la mayoría de los países restantes en África. Un análisis de la relevancia de los modelos en los conjuntos demuestra que los modelos constituyentes de la historia de conflictos que proporciona el {ViEWS} fueron dominantes en dichos conjuntos. Cette contribution au concours de prévision {ViEWS} (Violence early-warning system, système d’alerte précoce sur la violence) 2020 propose d’utiliser la modélisation de Markov pour modéliser l’évolution du logarithme des décès liés aux conflits entre deux moments de l’histoire d’un pays. Les prédictions sont effectuées à l’aide de deux ensembles de modèles de Markov cachés et de modèles de Markov observés, et les jeux de covariables de ces ensembles sont tirés des modèles constituants par mois et pays du système {ViEWS}. Les pondérations des modèles individuels des ensembles ont été obtenues en utilisant un algorithme génétique optimisant l’ajustement sur le score {TADDA} (Distance absolue ciblée avec augmentation de direction) dans un jeu de calibration. Les ensembles pondérés de modèles de Markov visibles et cachés sont plus performants que les modèles de référence du concours de prédiction {ViEWS} pour ce qui est du score {TADDA} de la période de test de janvier 2017 à décembre 2019, et ce pour tous les pas de temps. Les prévisions jusqu’à mars 2021 ont permis de prédire une augmentation de la violence principalement en Algérie, en Libye, au Tchad, au Niger et en Angola, et une diminution ou un maintien des niveaux de violence dans la plupart des autres pays d’Afrique. Une analyse des pondérations des modèles dans les ensembles montre que le modèle constituant basé sur l’histoire des conflits fourni par {ViEWS} serait dominant dans les ensembles.},

	abstract = {A crucial challenge for solving problems in conflict research is in leveraging the semi-supervised nature of the data that arise. Observed response data such as counts of battle deaths over time indicate latent processes of interest such as intensity and duration of conflicts, but defining and labeling instances of these unobserved processes requires nuance and imprecision. The availability of such labels, however, would make it possible to study the effect of intervention-related predictors - such as ceasefires - directly on conflict dynamics (e.g., latent intensity) rather than through an intermediate proxy like observed counts of battle deaths. Motivated by this problem and the new availability of the {ETH}-{PRIO} Civil Conflict Ceasefires data set, we propose a Bayesian autoregressive ({AR}) hidden Markov model ({HMM}) framework as a sufficiently flexible machine learning approach for semi-supervised regime labeling with uncertainty quantification. We motivate our approach by illustrating the way it can be used to study the role that ceasefires play in shaping conflict dynamics. This ceasefires data set is the first systematic and globally comprehensive data on ceasefires, and our work is the first to analyze this new data and to explore the effect of ceasefires on conflict dynamics in a comprehensive and cross-country manner.},

	abstract = {Despite a growing body of literature focusing on ceasefires, it is unclear if most ceasefires achieve their primary objective of stopping violence. Motivated by this question and the new availability of the {ETH}-{PRIO} Civil Conflict Ceasefires Dataset, we develop a Bayesian hidden Markov modeling ({HMM}) framework for studying the dynamics of violence in civil wars. This ceasefires data set is the first systematic and globally comprehensive data on ceasefires, and our work is the first to analyze this new data and to explore the effect of ceasefires on conflict dynamics in a comprehensive and cross-country manner. We find that ceasefires do indeed seem to produce a significant decline in subsequent violence. However, the pre-ceasefire period (the period typically after a ceasefire agreement has been negotiated but before it is in effect) is shown to be prone to periods of intensified violence that are most likely a cause and effect of the subsequent ceasefire. This finding has significant implications for the research and practice community. Moreover, manifesting from the ubiquity of modern data repositories combined with a deficiency in meaningful labels, {HMM}-based semi-supervised data labeling strategies could pave the way for the next decade of conflict research progress.},

Resort to War lists and categorizes all violent conflicts with 1,000 or more battle deaths and provides an insightful narrative for each struggle. The volume distinguishes between traditional interstate war, the phenomenon of extra-state war as evidenced by the Al-Qaeda– {USA} conflagration, intra-state war, and the new category of nonstate ethnic wars. After explaining how to determine what a “state” is and how to classify different types of wars, the authors describe each encounter and highlight major patterns across eras and regions, identifying which categories of war are becoming more or less prevalent over time, and revealing connections between the different types of war. Resort to War, the second title in the Correlates of War Series, is a definitive source for students and researchers examining patterns of international conflict; it is the essential guide to the data, trends, and context of these violent encounters.

Hidden Markov models have an extensive history in a wide variety of pattern classification applications. In these models, an unobserved finite state Markov chain generates observed symbols whose distribution is conditioned on the current state of the chain. Training algorithms estimate model parameters based upon known patterns of symbols. Assignment rules classify unknown patterns according to the likelihood of known models generating the observed symbols. The research presented here utilized much of the Hidden Markov model methodology, but not for pattern classification, rather to identify the underlying finite state Markov chain for a symbol realization. Machine coded newswire story leads provided event data that served as the symbol realization for the Hidden Markov model. Fundamental matrices derived from the Markov chain led to forecasts that provide insight into the dynamic behavior of the conflict and describe potential futures of the conflict in probabilistic terms, to include the likelihood of conflict, the time to conflict, and the time in conflict.},
